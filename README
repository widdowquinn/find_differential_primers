BASIC USE:
If you do not have complete genome sequences use the 'stitch_six_frame_stops.py'
script to stitch together the contigs of a single genome (contained within one
multi-FASTA formatted file). The script does this by stitching the contigs with
the following sequence 'NNNNNCATTCCATTCATTAATTAATTAATGAATGAATGNNNNN'. This
sequence contains start and stop codons in all frames. Remember the default 
workflow is to only find primers within CDS regions.

Once all genomes have been stitched together, make a config file similar
to the example within the 'O104_primers_5.conf' file.

Finally, run 'find_differential_primers.py'.
